WHEN DROUGHT BECOMES "DRAUGHT"
TEXT: LUKE 5:1-11.
<h2 id="Keyverse">Memory Verse</h2>
üîëKEY VERSE "Now when he had left speaking, he said unto Simon, Launch out into the deep, and let down your nets for a draught" (LUKE 5:4).

<pre>
  Charles H. Spurgeon told the story of his first student who walked up to him and complained that he had been preaching for several months without recording a¬† single conversion. "And do you expect," said Mr Spurgeon, "that the Lord is going to bless you and save souls every time you open your mouth?" "No, sir," he replied. "Well, then," said Mr Spurgeon, "that is why you do not get souls saved. If you had believed, the Lord would have given the blessing."

  Peter believed Christ when He instructed him to launch out into the deep and let down the nets for a catch. The result of his faith and obedience was "great multitude of fishes." They had toiled all night - with all their professional skills - but caught nothing. This was at the Sea of Galilee (here called the Lake of Gennesaret). A vast multitude of people had gathered to listen to Christ by the seaside because there was no public facility that could accommodate such crowd. Peter volunteered his fishing boat in which Christ stood to minister to the people and in return got this miracle of draught of fishes.

  Like Peter, we can go from drought (lack) to a draught of desired blessings. But we must first be willing to lay our all on the altar of sacrifice for the Lord. If Peter begrudged Christ the use of his boat, he would have missed the great catch. Also, we labour in vain when we rely only on our own wisdom, experience, strength and talent (especially in ministry). We must learn to act at God's word and the Spirit's prompting even when it seems unreasonable in the circumstance.

  In addition, disappointments and failures should not deter us from taking steps when God prompts us. No matter how discouraged you have been to have toiled in vain, resolve, like Peter: "...nevertheless at thy word I will let down the net."

  ‚úçTHOUGHT FOR THE DAY Faith in God's faithfulness forestalls failures and frustration.

  MEDITATION

  Sure profits in wholehearted surrender

  1. Revival of truth
  When people are eager and thirsty to hear the pure word of God from holiness emphasising preacher like Christ, then that is biblical revival, v1.
  Q Are you experiencing true revival in your life and your church?
  2. Resignation to fate
  When Jesus is in the boat, resignation to unpleasant fate is an act of unbelief, v2. Invite Him to your situation and He will give you a miracle.
  3. Right position of teaching
  One of the primary duty of Christ centred ministry is to teach the mind of God to seekers clearly, convincingly and correctly, v3.
  Q Is life transforming teaching ministry emphasised in your assembly? Be like Christ
  4. Rendering of treasures
  One of the greatest sacrifice is to give up your sources of sustenance and satisfaction for Christ's course, v3.
  Q Are you willing of required? There are blessing there!
  5. Rejection of temptations
  In the school of faith there are always temptations through reasoning that will tend  to block obedience of faith. Always reject it and simply trust His word, v5.
  Q Do you allow reason or faith to dominate the word of God in your life?
  6. Reward of trust
  The fishermen were not even expecting a reward for their sacrifice, yet Jesus surprised them. No service or sacrifice of your time, talent and treasures, no matter how unnoticed, to the course of Christ will go unrewarded now and in eternity, vv4, 6,7.
  Note Little is much when the glory of God is the motive.
  7. The riches of trusting
  Simeon's faith became a blessing to others. A righteous man of faith will always be a blessing to their generations, v7.
  7. Response of true piety
  Peter had met Christ before without full surrender of His career and future. This time around, he surrendered his life career and future to Christ. Consecration to deeper walk with Christ should be the immediate response of those who have been blessed by Christ, vv8,11.
  Q How do you respond to Christ's grace in your life?
